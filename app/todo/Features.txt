New Features
done TODO
F1
As a user, when I click the todo_, I will be redirected to CreateEditTodo screen and the title and description text fields will be
populated by the todo_'s existing title and description.

done TODO
F2
As a user, when I am in CreateEditTodo screen, and when I edit the text fields, and when I click the check floating icon button,
the todo_ will be saved and the new todo_ details will reflect to the list of todos in main screen.
and I will be redirected back to the main screen.

TODO
F3
As a user, I want to have an online account.
So that when I user another device, my data will be backed up.
So that when I use more than one device, my data will be synced with all my devices.
- try, when app first loads, check if user is online. If he is, compare the data between remote and local, use versionKey as reference,
if versionKeys are different, it means that the data was updated. Compare each item, if one exists remotely, insert it in local.
If one exists locally, insert it in remote db.

TODO
F4
As a user, I want that my details be saved locally after I login, so that when I open the app even offline,
my details e.g. first name, email, etc. is visible on the app.
- save the user details in user table similar to user table in the backend.
and retrieve the user details thru query SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = :id

done TODO
F5
As a developer, I want the to make the focus state of title textfield to true when I navigate to AddEditTodoScreen.

done TODO
F6
As a developer, I want to remove the delete icon from the todo_ list, and move it to the AddEditTodoScreen instead.
- at the top right of the screen, have a vertical more icon, then a pop up will appear with a menu item of "Delete"
- which is when clicked, the todo_ will be deleted and the user will be redirected to the TodoListScreen.

done TODO
F7
As a developer, I want to maintain the order of todos before and after I edit and delete a todo_
- current behaviour is that the new todo_ will always be put at the last of the list
- possible solution, add a createdAt field, and then always arrange the todo_ by date, from latest to oldest.

done TODO
F8
As a developer, I want to remove the extra space for description when description is null or empty.
- current behaviour is that the description always contains vertical space.

done TODO
F9
As a developer, I want to maintain the two lines for description in TodoListScreen, with ellipsis.

done TODO
F10
As a developer, I want the id as the screen path params instead of the whole todo_ when a todo_ is clicked
- current implementation is that the todo_ is hinahanap muna ang todo_ then buong todo_ ang pinapasa as param.
- fixed the performance issue. buong todo_ parin pinapasa pero hindi na nagkakaroon ng search task. may copy na pala ng todo_.

TODO
F11
As a developer, I want to trigger the create todo_ functionality when the return key on keyboard is clicked.
- make the return key as check.

TODO
F11
As a developer, I want to make CreateTodoScreen separate but not a screen but a bottom drawer
- similar to google tasks

TODO
F12
As a developer, I want to make this app a Daily Tasks, in which the main list is the current todos of the day
- that is, when the day becomes tomorrow, the todos for yesterday will be moved at the bottom with Inactive (2) toggle
- the current todos of the day is Active todos
- similar to googles tasks "Completed (2)" where 2 is the number of completed todos, or in this app, the number of Inactive todos.

TODO
F13
As a developer, I want the app to use BasicTextField instead of TextField
- so that, we can avoid the default Material UI TextField that has border bottom
- check if this looks more beautiful. If not, revert.

TODO
F14
As a developer, I want the width of the DropdownMenu become 1/2 of the screen.


done TODO
B1
When I delete a todo_, and undo it, snack bar will always appear everytime I go back to the TodoListScreen.
- fixed using SharedPreferences

done TODO
B2
When I click a complete todo_, then press check to save even if without editing, the isComplete status becomes false.
- the correct behaviour should remain the isComplete status of the todo_.
